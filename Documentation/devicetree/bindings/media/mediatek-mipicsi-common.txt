* Mediatek MIPI-CSI2 receiver common

Mediatek MIPI-CSI2 receiver is the MIPI Signal capture hardware present in Mediatek SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "mediatek,mt2712-mipicsi-common"
- reg : physical base address of the mipicsi receiver registers and length of
  memory mapped region.
- clocks: device clocks, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.


Example:
	mipicsi: mipicsi@15002000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt2712-mipicsi-common", "syscon";
		reg = <0 0x15002000 0 0x10>;
		clocks = <&imgsys CLK_IMG_SENINF_CAM_EN>,
			 <&imgsys CLK_IMG_SENINF_SCAM_EN>;
	};
